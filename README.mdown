CSS Extended Bundle for TextMate
================================

About
-----

This is a bundle for the [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) text editor. It gives you additional quick shortcuts for CSS and new CSS3 properties. Where possible, it will maximize cross-browser compatibility by combining `-prefixed` experimental properties with the standard property, so the browser will fall back on the experimental version if the standard version isn't supported. Example:

	-moz-border-radius-topright:3px;
	-webkit-border-top-right-radius:3px;
	-khtml-border-top-right-radius:3px;
	border-radius-top-right:3px;

Features
--------

- `border-radius` and `border-radius-`*side*
- `box-shadow`
- `display: inline-block`
- `text-overflow: ellipsis`
- `transition`
- `box-sizing`
- `min-height`
- `transform`
- `background:` *linear gradient*
- More to come...

Installation
------------

- Install TextMate
- Download and double-click the css-extended.tmbundle
- Done!
